Notes:

- [Using GHCi](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/8.6.5/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html)
- There is a difference between `div`/`mod` and `quot`/`rem`. Be careful when choosing between these functions. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/28027235/391924.
- Haskell doesn't evaluate everything to canonical or normal form by default. Instead, it only evaluates to weak head normal form (WHNF) by default.
