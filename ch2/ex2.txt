1.

a) 8 + 7 * 9   = 8 + (7 * 9) = 71
b) (8 + 7) * 9 = 15 * 9      = 135

In a), * has higher precedence than +.

2.

a) perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
b) perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2
                 = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
                 = a)

Both will give the same answer since * has higher precedence than +.

3.

a) f x = x / 2 + 9
       = (x / 2) + 9

For e.g. f 2 = 2 / 2 + 9 = 10

b) f x = x / (2 + 9)

For e.g. f 2 = 2 / (2 + 9) = 2 / 11

They are not equal in general.
